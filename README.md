# Classification-Model
The task is to implement the Naive Bayes algorithm that is able to predict the domain - one of Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota or Virus - from the abstract of research papers about proteins taken from the MEDLINE database. 
The ultimate goal of this programming project is to come up with an implementation of a (possibly extended or modified) Naive Bayes algorithm, that achieves a high predictive accuracy on the test data. As a minimum requirement your implementation should be at least as good (or better) than a standard version of Naive Bayes as explained for example in Mitchell's "Machine Learning" textbook. Your algorithm should still be "Naive Bayes" in the sense that it makes the assumption that all attributes are conditionally independent of each other given the class.

 # Executive Summary
This project was undertaken as part of the COMPSCI 361 competition, which involved over 200 participants submitting their classification models to Kaggle. The objective was to surpass the baseline accuracy of 77.5% set by a Naive Bayes algorithm. Across the course, the average model accuracy achieved was 89%. My submission significantly exceeded this benchmark, achieving an accuracy of 97.7%, closely approaching the highest recorded accuracy of 98.3% in the competition.
